\section{Introduction}
Welcome to a new way of working with LaTeX. For many years, using LaTeX meant dealing with complex installations or waiting for slow cloud compilers. This platform changes that by bringing the entire \textbf{TeX Live} ecosystem directly into your web browser.

By combining the precision of the original \TeX\ system \cite{knuth1984tex, lamport1994latex} with modern web technology \cite{wasm2017}, we have created an environment that is fast, reliable, and incredibly easy to use. Whether you are a seasoned researcher or a student writing your first paper, you will find everything you need right here.
